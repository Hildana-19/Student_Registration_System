Student Registration System – Java Swing GUI

Project Overview

This is a desktop-based Student Registration System built entirely in Java using Swing GUI. It allows users to sign up or log in and fill out registration forms for various education levels: "Bachelor", "Master", and "Extension Programs" (such as ITS and Software Engineering).

The system demonstrates key Object-Oriented Programming principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction. It uses SQLite for persistent data storage and follows a modular structure to separate concerns such as database handling, UI components, file logging, and validation.

Setup and Execution Instructions:

Prerequisites
- Java: JDK 8 or later installed
- SQLite JDBC driver 
- IDE like VS Code, NetBeans, or any Java-supporting editor

Running the Project:


Team Contributions

- Debora Dereje – Designed and implemented the Master’s Registration Form and related UI components.
- Hildana Birhanu – Developed the Extension Program Registration Form and worked on its layout and functionality.
- Hoise Dereje – Created the Bachelor’s Registration Form, managing both design and data handling.
- Yeabsira Addis – Built the Signup/Login system, including validation and authentication logic.

> This collaborative project applied Java OOP principles, GUI design, and database integration in a real-world-style desktop application.
